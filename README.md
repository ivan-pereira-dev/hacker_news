Hackers news app using Combine and Swift UI in iOs

These are resources to learn Combine:

[Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/combine-asynchronous-programming-with-swift)
[Getting started with the Combine framework in Swift](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/combine/)
[Will combine kill RxSwift](https://medium.com/@M0rtyMerr/will-combine-kill-rxswift-64780a150d89)


## What is Combine?

Combine is a new  **reactive**  framework created by Apple that streamlines how you can process asynchronous operations.

Combine code is  **declarative**  and succinct, making it easy to write and read once you have a basic understanding of it.

Combine also allows you to neatly organize related code in one place instead of having that code spread out across multiple files.

The technologies learned in the course were:

-   Publishers, Subscribers and Operators
    
-   Transforming Operators
    
-   Filtering Operators
    
-   Combining Operators
    
-   Sequence Operators
    
-   Combine for Networking
    
-   Debugging Combine
    
-   Combine Timers
        
-   Understanding MVVM Design Pattern
    
-   SwiftUI Basics
    
-   Understanding State and Binding


## Conclusions
Combine is mostly useful when there are complicated data "flows" - i.e., multiple sources generating input independently, like bluetooth or network calls that have to be processed and result in some outputs.

This technology has a lot of potential for IoT projects since these rely a lot on collecting and manipulating data.
